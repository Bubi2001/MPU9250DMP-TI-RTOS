A comprehensive, easy-to-use I2C driver for the MPU-9250 IMU, specifically tailored for the **TI-RTOS** environment on the **MSP-EXP432E401Y** platform. This library offers multiple levels of abstraction to get you up and running quickly.

This library provides everything you need to go from raw sensor readings to a fully calibrated, high-performance orientation solution.

## Features

-**Multi-Level API:** Choose the abstraction level that fits your needs:

- A simple C library for direct register access and raw data.
- A high-level C++ class that encapsulates the complex InvenSense DMP.
- A C-compatible wrapper for using the DMP from any C project.

-**Sensor Fusion Options:** Includes a lightweight **Complementary Filter** and a full implementation of the onboard **Digital Motion Processor (DMP)** for 6-axis quaternion output.

-**TI-RTOS Integration:** Designed from the ground up for a real-time, task-based environment, using TI Drivers for I2C and TI-RTOS primitives for timing.

The core DMP driver is based on the work by InvenSense/TDK.

The C++ wrapper is an adaptation of the excellent [SparkFun MPU-9250 DMP Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_MPU-9250-DMP_Arduino_Library).
